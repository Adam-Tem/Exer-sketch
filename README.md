# Exer-sketch
A new fitness gamification app that encourages users to come up with creative routes by trying to get the GPS map to look like a particular shape!

## What is Exer-sketch?

Exer-sketch is a new mobile app that challenges its users to stay active by coming up with new routes to match the particular shape of the day. Every 24 hours, users will be presented with a new shape, where the goal is to "draw" a GPS outline route that matches this shape as close as possible. Points will be awarded depending on how big the shape is and how close it is to the exact outline.

## Why I'm making this project

The reason behind developing this app is that it will allow me to continue to develop my programming skills, having to design both the frontend and backend to provide a complete user experience. Fitness is a passion of mine and I want to try and encourage others to stay active by creating incentives and challenges to keep them motivated for sport. Building a community would be the ultimate goal, providing an app where people can compete against others in a friendly way and share their progress through endurance sport.
