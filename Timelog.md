# Exer-sketch Project Timelog

Below is the daily workflow of the Exer-sketch project: goals achieved, problems identified and potential next steps. I will fill this in every time I work on the project, as a way of tracking progress while also holding myself accountable to put a good amount of hours towards this and trying to stay consistent.

Project repo has officially been set up and some basic goals and outlines identified.

Just gone and made sure that node and python are all up to date and good to go for the project. Managed to do a little exploring of the Strava API but feel that it may be easier to first parse a GPX file and then get the exports from the API, just in case I do not end up using the Strava API. Managed to get the first little bit of GPX parsing done, by getting the lat/long value of the first point in a file.
