# Exer-sketch: Project Goals

This project will involve developing both a frontend and backend for a mobile application so will require a wide range of programming skills. The focus will be divided between the two throughout the entire project, finding a balance by trying to develop both aspects at a steady rate. The goals listed below are general outline for the application

## Frontend Goals

The goals for the frontend development for the Exer-sketch app are as follows:

- Provide an interface so users can see their uploaded GPS maps.
- Allow users to navigate to other user profiles, providing the ability to follow other users.
- Allow users to customise their profile, such as profile picture and bio.
- Let users select an upload and see the details of the "shape match": % match to the shape, size of the shape.
- Let users adjust the title of their own posts and comment on others' posts.
- Present to users what the "shape of the day" is.
- Let users view global leaderboards for that day.
- Let users see what level they are at and how many points they need to get to the next stage.

## Backend Goals

- Create an algorithm that can identify the sketch created by a GPS map.
- Store user uploads in a database, so previous efforts can be analysed.
- Develop a point scoring system that provides a balanced scale between creating a large GPS shape and the % closeness to the "shape of the day".
- Provide a login system for users so they can safely and securely access their account.
- Create a connection to sports app API (Strava, Garmin, etc.) so users' activities can automatically be uploaded to the app.
- Create a level system so users have personal goals to chase in the app.
